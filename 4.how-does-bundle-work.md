### How Does Bundle Work?

```ruby
JSON.parse("xxxxx")
```

What will happen for your rubygems/rails project?

1. First of all, you have to run `bundle install` which will
    + Read the Gemfile Gemfile.lock
    + Ask RubyGems.org for a list of gem we want
    + If needed, find gem versions allowed by the Gemfile that work together
    + If found, write down those versions in the lock for future installs
    + Install gems as needed until every gem in the lock is installed
2. After that in the rails boot process, it will run

    ```ruby
    ENV['BUNDLE_GEMFILE'] ||= File.expand_path('../Gemfile', __dir__)
    require 'bundler/setup' # Set up gems listed in the Gemfile
    ```
    + `setup.rb` is responsible for reading `Gemfile.lock` and calling `gem` method for each gem with correct version and load that gem. It can do it because Rubygems replaces the default `require` method with its own version which will add that gem to your `$LOADPATH`
