### How Does Bundle Work?

```ruby
require('json')

JSON.parse("xxxxx")
```

What will happen for your rubygems/rails project?

1. First of all, you have to run `bundle install` which will
    + Read the Gemfile ( Gemfile.lock )
    + Ask RubyGems.org for a list of gem we want
    + If needed, find gem versions allowed by the Gemfile that work together
    + If found, write down those versions in the lock for future installs
    + Install gems as needed until every gem in the lock is installed
2. In the rails boot process, it will run

    ```ruby
    ENV['BUNDLE_GEMFILE'] ||= File.expand_path('../Gemfile', __dir__)
    require 'bundler/setup' # Set up gems listed in the Gemfile
    ```
    
    + `setup.rb` is responsible for reading `Gemfile.lock` and calling `gem` method for each gem with correct version and load that gem. It can do it because Rubygems replaces the default `require` method with its own version which will add that gem lib to your `$LOADPATH`
 3. Ruby will load json.rb, `require` needs to figure out where the file is. It looks in all the paths in `$LOAD_PATHS`. If it can not be found, Rubygems will look for the installed gems which have the file called `json.rb`, after that adds into `$LOAD_PATHS`. `require` continues like normal, but this time it is able to find the file called `json.rb`. Inside `json.rb`, it defines a module `JSON` and related stuffs like `require('json/common')`.
