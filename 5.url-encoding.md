### URL Encoding

When you receive a link from a resource, you have to ask yourself whether that link is already encoded or not. Depending on link's type we will have different kind of parse for it.

For example: https://mquy.github.io/url-encoding+chrome
  + after encoding: 
    - `+` presents for ` `
    - Therefore, the original link is `https://mquy.github.io/url-encoding chrome`
  + before encoding:
    - `+` presents for `+`
    - Therefore, the original link is `https://mquy.github.io/url-encoding+chrome`

  ```text
  The reserved characters are different for each part.

  For HTTP URLs, a space in a path fragment part has to be encoded to "%20" (not, absolutely not "+"), while the "+" character in the path fragment part can be left unencoded.

  Now in the query part, spaces may be encoded to either "+" (for backwards compatibility: do not try to search for it in the URI standard) or "%20" while the "+" character (as a result of this ambiguity) has to be escaped to "%2B".

  This means that the "blue+light blue" string has to be encoded differently in the path and query parts:

  "http://example.com/blue+light%20blue?blue%2Blight+blue".

  From there you can deduce that encoding a fully constructed URL is impossible without a syntactical awareness of the URL structure.
