### Funtional Approach To Domain Driven Design

#### 1. Core Principles of FP Design
  + Functions are things: It is standalone thing, not attached to a class and it is the first-class citizen
  
  + Composition everywhere
  
  + Types are not classes:
  
    - Type is just a name given to set a valid inputs/outputs
    - Types can be composed
      
      For examples:
      
      > Set of people x Set of dates = type __Birthday__
      
#### 2. Design Principle
  + Strive for totality: It is a concept that for every input for a function, there is a valid output. It means that we can base on function types `our_method:: int -> int` to documentation/trust

  + Functions as parameters:
    - Parameterize all the things
    
      <table>
      <tr>
      <td>Before</td>
      <td>After</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>
      
      ```ruby
      def print_list
        [1..10].each { |element| puts "the number is #{element}" }
      end
      ```
      
      </td>
      <td>
      
      ```ruby
      def print_list(list, action)
        list.each { |element| action(element) }
      end
      ```
      
      </td>
      </tr>
      </table>

    - Partial application & dependency injection

      <table>
      <tr>
      <td>Before</td>
      <td>After</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>
      
      ```ruby
      name = "Scott"
      puts "Hello, my name is #{name}"
      ```
      
      </td>
      <td>
      
      ```ruby
      full_name = "Scott"
      hello = -> { |name| puts name }
      hello(full_name)
      ```
      
      </td>
      </tr>
      </table>

#### 3. Monad

Long story short, it is chaining computation

#### 4. Monoid
The thing that sastify three rules below is monoid
  - Rule 1 (Closure): The result of combining two things is always another one of the things ( means input and output have same type)
    -> converts pairwise operations into operations that works on lists
    ```ruby
    "a" + "b" + "c" + "d"
    ["a", "b", "c", "d"].reduce("+")
    ```
  - Rule 2 (Associativity): When combining more than two things, which pairwise you do first doesn't matter
    -> devive and conquer, parallelization and incremental accumulation
  - Rule 3 (Identity element): There is a special thing called "zero" such that when you combine any thing with "zero" you get the original thing back
    -> Initial value for empty or missing data which will be used for two cases above


```ruby
order_line = { quantity: 1, weight: 4.5 } # -> monoid
order_lines = [
  { quantity: 1, weight: 4.5 },
  { quantity: 2, weight: 9 }
]                                         # -> any combination of monoids is also a monoids

addPair = -> do |order_line1, order_line2|
  new_quantity = order_line1[:quantity] + order_line2[:quantity]
  new_weight = order_line1[:weight] + order_line2[:weight]
  { quantity: new_quantity, weight: new_weight }
end

order_lines.reduce(addPair)
```
