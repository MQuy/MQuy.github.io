### Clean Code

#### Architecture, Use Cases and High Level Design

  + Architecture is not based on tools and frameworks. It means that it does not depend on the delivery mechanism ( for example web).
  
  + It allows business to separate the costs of the use cases from the cost of UI or other components.
  
  + Use cases should be primary abstractions and central organizing of the system. It means when you look at a system you should see the intent of a system.
  
  + MVC/MVP might be good for web, therefore we use simple plain old objects to communicate between it and use cases.
