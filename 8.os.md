## Operating System

### What is it?
 
  Operating System is the program that manages a computer's hardware, provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between the user and hardware.
  
  Key features:
  
  + Hide hardware complexity
  
  + Resource management
  
  + Provide isolation & protection

### Process
 Process is instance of an executing program. In theory, the process model is based on two independent concepts: resource grouping and execute.
  + Resource grouping: process has an address space, containing text, data and other reosources.
  + Execute: thread of execution, shorten, thread. Threads are the entities scheduled for execution on the CPU.
 
 | Per process items           | Per thread items |
 | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
 | Address space               | Program counter  |
 | Global variables            | Registers        |
 | Open files                  | Stack            |
 | Child processes             | State            |
 | Pending alarms              |                  |
 | Signals and signal handlers |                  |
 | Accounting information      |                  |
 
 
#### 1. Context switch

  There are the different between context switch in process and thread
  
  + Process switching: involves switching the memory spaces. On some architectures, it even means flushing various processor caches that aren't shareable across address space.
  + Thread switching: switch from one thread to another thread in the same process ( switching in different process is just process switching).

  > COLD cache is when process is changed from active to idle, all of its data are not in processor cache. When it becomes active, it has to load those data from memory. Memory is much more slower than processor cache.
