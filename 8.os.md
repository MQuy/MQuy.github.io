## Operating System

### What is it?
 
  Operating System is the program that manages a computer's hardware, provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between the user and hardware.
  
  Key features:
  
  + Hide hardware complexity
  
  + Resource management
  
  + Provide isolation & protection

### Process
 Process is instance of an executing program. In theory, the process model is based on two independent concepts: resource grouping and execute.
 
 | Per process items           | Per thread items |
 | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
 | Address space               | Program counter  |
 | Global variables            | Registers        |
 | Open files                  | Stack            |
 | Child processes             | State            |
 | Pending alarms              |                  |
 | Signals and signal handlers |                  |
 | Accounting information      |                  |

  > COLD cache is when process is changed from active to idle, all of its data are not in processor cache. When it becomes active, it has to load those data from memory. Memory is much more slower than processor cache.
