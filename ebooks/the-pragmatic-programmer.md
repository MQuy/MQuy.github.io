### The cat ate my source code
+ When something went wrong, proving options and don't make lame excuses.
+ Don't say it can't be done, explain the situation what can be done to salvage.

### Software Entropy
+ Don't leave "broken windows" unrepaired. (If you cannot fix it properly due to deadline, ... then at least commetting reasons for example TODO)
+ When involving into projects with "broken windowns", don't slip into mindset "All the rest of this code is crap, I will just follow suit." Following boy scout rule
