## Basic tools

#### The cat ate my source code
+ When something went wrong, proving options and don't make lame excuses.
+ Don't say it can't be done, explain the situation what can be done to salvage.

#### Software Entropy
+ Don't leave "broken windows" unrepaired. (If you cannot fix it properly due to deadline, ... then at least commetting reasons for example TODO)
+ When involving into projects with "broken windows", don't slip into mindset "All the rest of this code is crap, I will just follow suit." Following boy scout rule

#### Stone soup and boiled frogs
+ When doing something that you know how to do but it requires a lot of helps/permissions from others. Develop and show people  and let them marvel. Then say "of course, it would be better if we added ...", people find it easier to join an ongoing projects.
+ Constantly review what's happenning around you, not just what you personally are doing. If not, one day you will realize that projects get totally out of your hand.

#### Good enough software
+ The scope and quality of the system you produce should be specifid as part of that system's requirement.
+ Deliver small and quick to get users' feedback.

#### Your knowledge protfolio
Invest regularily via setting your goals:
+ Learn  at least one new language every year.
+ Read a technical book each quartar.
+ Read nontechnical books because you also need to communicate with others.
+ Take classes, participate in local user groups, experiment with different environments.

Making these things above become your habits.

Admit when you don't know and find an answer via guru, internet, sending email, ....

Plan ahead what you will read and learn, also analyzing what you read and hear. Answers may or may not be applicable to you despite they are answered by popular people, top searching, ...

#### Communicate
Write an outline, jot down the ideas you want to communicate and plan a couple of strategies when aruging about them. To make it affectly you have to
+ Know your audience.
+ Choose the right moment ("is this a good time to talk about ...?").
+ Make it look good.
+ Involve your audience, it is better to get their feedback during your process.
+ If you want them to listen, you have to listen to them firstly (encourage people to talk by asking questions).

## A pragmatic approach

### The evils of duplication
Every piece of knowledge should have a single representation within a system.

In order to prevent duplication, we need to know what/where, there are 4 kinds of duplication

#### Imposed duplication
It mostly comes from project standards, multiple target platforms(client-server, languages). We cannot avoid but we can make it less worse for example code generator.

Remember documentation is also an knowledge, therefore, keeping it as high-level explainations as you can.

#### Inadvertent duplication
Developer don't realize they are duplicating information due to the misunderstand/mistake in the design/requirement.

#### Impatient duplication
It might be from developer lazyness or time pressures that can drive us to take shortcurts for example, copy function/class and make few changes.

Remember "shortcuts make for long delays"

#### Interdeveloper duplication
It happens due to many people on a team, different teams, ... The best way to encourage active and frequent communication between developers (setup channel/room to discuss common problems). At the high level, it needs a clear design, however, at the module level, commonly needed functionality or data should be located in obvious/shared areas.

### Orthogonality
