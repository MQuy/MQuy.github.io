### The cat ate my source code
+ When something went wrong, proving options and don't make lame excuses.
+ Don't say it can't be done, explain the situation what can be done to salvage.

### Software Entropy
+ Don't leave "broken windows" unrepaired. (If you cannot fix it properly due to deadline, ... then at least commetting reasons for example TODO)
+ When involving into projects with "broken windows", don't slip into mindset "All the rest of this code is crap, I will just follow suit." Following boy scout rule

### Stone soup and boiled frogs
+ When doing something that you know how to do but it requires a lot of helps/permissions from others. Develop and show people  and let them marvel. Then say "of course, it would be better if we added ...", people find it easier to join an ongoing projects.
+ Constantly review what's happenning around you, not just what you personally are doing. If not, one day you will realize that projects get totally out of your hand.

### Good enough software
+ The scope and quality of the system you produce should be specifid as part of that system's requirement.
+ Deliver small and quick to get users' feedback.
