## SQL Comparator `=` vs `LIKE`

`=` is a comparision operator that operates on numbers and strings.
`LIKE` is a string operator.a

The different between them are:
+ `=` compares the entire string while `LIKE` compares one character at a time (both comparisons use the current collation).
+ `LIKE` supports wildcards while `=` doesn't

For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT 'ä' LIKE 'ae' COLLATE latin1_german2_ci;
+-----------------------------------------+
| 'ä' LIKE 'ae' COLLATE latin1_german2_ci |
+-----------------------------------------+
|                                       0 |
+-----------------------------------------+
mysql> SELECT 'ä' = 'ae' COLLATE latin1_german2_ci;
+--------------------------------------+
| 'ä' = 'ae' COLLATE latin1_german2_ci |
+--------------------------------------+
|                                    1 |
+--------------------------------------+
```

The result of `=` is true because it takes whole strings and use collation latin1_german2_ci to compare `'ä'` and `'ae'`, in german latin they are the same.
