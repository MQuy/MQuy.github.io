## V8 Engine Overview

### Pipeline

From time to time, the V8's architecture is changed gradually. In old versions, the design is quite complicated and hard to extend. Recently, the core team decided to change the approach to make it more generic in order to "plugin" the support for ES6, ES7 and so on.

You can check the more details on V8's timeline via [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_eLlVzcj94_G4r9j9d_Lj5HRKFnq6jgpuPJtnmIBs88/edit#slide=id.g2134da681e_0_59) and [video](https://youtu.be/M1FBosB5tjM?t=6m).

Nowaday, the V8's pipeline looks like the picture below

Why we have two stages: **Interpreter Ignition** and **Compiler Turbo Fan**, the reason behind is that we have to balance between the startup time, memory and peek peformation because V8 is not only used for browser in desktop but also for mobile, and in some cases we actually want to have fast startup time.

Using the image below, a vertical line for what we can get, so, you know what will happen ðŸ˜‚.

#### Ignition

Why we need Ignition, to know the reason we have to clock the time back when the old V8 and other Javascript enignes get their speed via JIT of script to native code immediately prior to execution. The code is compiled from JIT can consume a significant amount of memory, even if the code is only executed once. 

Using Ignition, V8 compiles code into bytecode which is between 50% to 25% the size of JIT-compiled code.

Hum, we have to recompile again to machine code? ðŸ¤”

Actually, Ignition was borned after TurboFan, therefore, it can make use of TurboFan. In this case, the bytecode from Ignition can be given to TurboFan and process further without recompiling. According V8 team [introduction](https://v8project.blogspot.com/2016/08/firing-up-ignition-interpreter.html) The bytecode is executed with the execution speed closes to those code generated by V8's previous baseline compiler.

```
invoke function --> Ignition --> bytecode --> TurboFan (compile part) --> machine code
```

#### TurboFan

When a block of code is invoked, it turns from "cold" to "warm" and from "warm" to "hot" if it is called multiple times. When the code is considered as "hot", TurboFan will optimize it based on feedbacks from previous calls (for example assuming variables type) as you can see from the image below.

Note: Previously, V8 used Code objects for property access in Inline Cache but it impacts on the page load time. When introducing Ignition, V8 generalizes the TurboFan based code generation architecture, so, we can use it for code stubs (inline cache). It reduces the overhead during page load time and number of tiny Code objects. Bascially, the information how to load and store properties is encoded via data format (FeedbackVector is attached to function), therefore, TurboFan performs the appropriate based on those information.

The image below is TurboFan's pipeline. As mentioned before, the byte code from Ignition (Interpreter Assembler) can be plugged into machine code's build process.

### Element Kinds
For optimization proposes, V8 chooses to separately store numeric properties from non-numeric properties and calls them as **element**

![kinds](https://i.imgur.com/onlErPb.png)

There are 3 basic types of elements:
+ Small integer
+ Double
+ Regular element

The kind of elements of an array is not set in stone, it can change at runtime and only from specific kind to more general kinds. Besides, for each kind of elements, V8 has PACKED and HOLEY and it only can change from PACKED to HOLEY. More important, operations on packed array are more efficient than operations in holey array.

```
const array = new Array(3) // => HOLEY_SMI_ELEMENTS

array[0] = 1.2 => HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS
array[1] = 'b' => HOLEY_ELEMENTS
array[2] = 'c' => HOLEY_ELEMENTS (stils)
```

* V8 creates buffer of 60 elements for empty array

### Code caching after execution
+ Cold load: Chrome see the visited webpage for the first time and doesn't have any data cached at all.
+ Warm load: Chrome remembers that webpack was already visisted and can retrieve certan assets from the cache. V8 recognizes same scripts were shipped, and therefore caches the compiled code along with the script file in the disk cache.
+ Hot laod: The third time Chrome visits the webpage, when serving file from the disk cache, it also provides V8 with the code cached during the previous load. V8 can use this cached code to avoid having to parse and compile this script from scratch.

Begining of version 6.6, V8 caches the code generated after the script's top-level execution along with lazy functions can be cached as well. Besides, V8 are able to parse and compile source code in background thread.
