## V8 Engine

### Pipeline

From time to time, the V8's architecture is changed gradually. In old versions, the design is quite complicated and hard to extend. Recently, the core team decided to change the approach to make it more generic in order to "plugin" the support for ES6, ES7 and so on.

You can check the more details on V8's timeline via [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_eLlVzcj94_G4r9j9d_Lj5HRKFnq6jgpuPJtnmIBs88/edit#slide=id.g2134da681e_0_59) and [video](https://youtu.be/M1FBosB5tjM?t=6m).

Nowaday, the V8's pipeline looks like the picture below

Why we have two stages: **Interpreter Ignition** and **Compiler Turbo Fan**, the reason behind is that we have to balance between the startup time, memory and peek peformation because V8 is not only used for browser in desktop but also for mobile, and in some cases we actually want to have fast startup time.

Using the image below, a vertical line for what we can get, so, you know what will happen ðŸ˜‚.

#### Ignition

Why we need Ignition, to know the reason we have to clock the time back when the old V8 and other Javascript enignes get their speed via JIT of script to native code immediately prior to execution. The code is compiled from JIT can consume a significant amount of memory, even if the code is only executed once. 

Using Ignition, V8 compiles code into bytecode which is between 50% to 25% the size of JIT-compiled code.

Hum, we have to recompile again to machine code? ðŸ¤”

Actually, Ignition was borned after TurboFan, therefore, it can make use of TurboFan. In this case, the bytecode from Ignition can be given to TurboFan and process further without recompiling. According V8 team [introduction](https://v8project.blogspot.com/2016/08/firing-up-ignition-interpreter.html) The bytecode is executed with the execution speed closes to those code generated by V8's previous baseline compiler.

```
invoke function --> Ignition --> bytecode --> TurboFan (compile part) --> machine code
```

#### TurboFan

When a block of code is invoked, it turns from "cold" to "warm" and from "warm" to "hot" if it is called multiple times. When the code is considered as "hot", TurboFan will optimize it based on feedbacks from previous calls (for example assuming variables type) as you can see from the image below.

The image below is TurboFan's pipeline. As mentioned before, the byte code from Ignition (Interpreter Assembler) can be plugged into machine code's build process.
