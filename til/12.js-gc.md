## Javascript Garbage Collection

### Data structures Overview

In javascript, there are two kind of data: primitive type and object.

Primitive types (we have 6 types: boolean, null, undefined, number, string and symbol) are immutable values. Except for null, undefined, all primitive values have object equivalents that wrap around the primitive values. Unlike the other primitives, Symbol doesn't have a literal syntax like '' for string.

Note:
+ Set is smiliar to collection (Array) except each element in Set is a unique. WeakSet is the Set with element is "weak" meaning gc can collect when variables are only from WeakSet (non-enumerable) and elements are only an Object.
+ Map is smiliar to Object except
  + An Object has a prototype while map doesn't have.
  + The keys of Object are String or Symbol, whereas they can be any values in Map.
  + Easily to get size of Map via `size` property.
+ Symbol doesn't show up (non-enumerable) on an Object using `for in`, `for of`, `Object.keys` ... The only way is by `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols`

```javascript
var fooSym = Symbol('foo');
var myObj = {};
myObj['foo'] = 'bar';
myObj[fooSym] = 'baz';
Object.keys(myObj); // -> [ 'foo' ]
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(myObj); // -> [ 'foo' ]
Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(myObj); // -> [ Symbol(foo) ]
```

+ Some static properties on the `Symbol` can be used to alter the behaviour of Javascript internals like String (match, search, split), Array (species) ....

### Garbage Collection

IE 6, 7 used reference-counting gc for DOM objects.
