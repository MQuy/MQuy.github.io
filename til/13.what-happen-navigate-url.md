## What Actually Happen When Navigating a URL

Basically, there are two stages:
+ Find an ip address based on browser url
+ Fetch resources from the server.


### Find an ip address
The DNS lookup process as follows:
+ Browser cache: Browser caches DNS records for some times, how long depends on browser implementation.
+ OS cache: If browser doesn't contain the desired record, the browser will make a system call. The OS has its own cache.
+ Router cache: The request continues to your router, which typically has its own cache.
+ ISP DNS cache: The next place to check is the cache ISP DNS cache.
+ Resursive cache: Your ISP server begins a resursive search, from a root nameserver through .xxx nameserver, .xxx nameserver.

### Fetch resources

#### Browser sends HTTP request to server
Once, the browser receives the correct IP address, it will use internet protocols (normally TCP) to build a connection with the server and transfer information. In order to transfer data packets, it is important to have a TCP connection established (TCP/IP three-way handshake):
+ Client sends a SYN packet to server asking if it is open for new connections.
+ If the server has open ports that can accept and initiate new connections, respond with and ACKnowledgment of the SYN pack using SYN/ACK packet.
+ Client will receive and send acknowledge it by sending an ACK packet.
After that, a TCP connection is established for data transmission.

Browser will send for example GET Request

```
GET http://facebook.com/ HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/x-ms-application, image/jpeg, application/xaml+xml, [...]
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; [...]
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
Host: facebook.com
Cookie: datr=1265876274-[...]; locale=en_US; lsd=WW[...]; c_user=2101[...]
```

Browser identifies itself (User-Agent), states what type of responses it will accept (Accept and Accept-Encoding), specific more additional information to server via cookies (key-value pairs which keeps track the state of of a website in between different requests).

Morever, based on **Connection** value, for example `Connetion: alive`, server keeps connection alive, it means subsequent requests to server uses the same TCP connection.

#### Server handles request
Server will receive the request, process it and send back a response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: private, no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0,
    pre-check=0
Expires: Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT
P3P: CP="DSP LAW"
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
X-Cnection: close
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

��������T�n�@����[...]
```
The **Content-Type** header tells the browser that response body is compressed using gzip algorithm, the blog at the end is the content of of request.
