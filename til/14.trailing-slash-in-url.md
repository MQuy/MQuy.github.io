## Trailing slash in URL

The main difference is that:

+ With slash: denotes directories (never files, no server guessing). It might mean `/games/` -> `/games/index.html`.
+ Without slash: considers as files.

In user point of view, with or without slash often serve the same content.

In term of search engine, it treats both links differently so it definitely has a bad effect in your ranking (it normally serves the same content).

Morever, it relates to historical reason. Back to the old day, we usually visited `/games/` as folder to view all files inside.
