## Transport Layer Security Handshake

### Handshake

The flow is:
+ The client sends a `ClientHello` message to the server with its TLS version, list of cipher algorithms and compression method available.
+ The server replies with a `ServerHello` message to client with the TLS version, selected cipher, selected compression method and server's public certificate signed by Certificate Authority.
+ The client verifies the server's digital certification. If trusted, the client will create the pre-master secret for the session and encrypt with public key above.
+ The server decrypts the pre-master secret by using its private key. Both server and client perform steps to generate the master secret with the agreed cipher.
 + The client sends a `Finished` message to the server, encrypting with the symmetric key.
+ The server verifies and send `Finished` message to the client. From now on, data will be encrypted with the agreed symmetric key.

### Public-key cryptography

You will have one private key and several public keys (give to client). Client uses public key to encrypt into message which only can be decrypted by using private key (pair with that public key).
+ Public key: encryption
+ Private key: decryption

Besides, there is a process named digital signatures, in which a message is signed with sender's private key and can be verifed by anyone who has access to the sender's public key.
