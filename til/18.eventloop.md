### Event loop

#### Background task
- `setTimeout` is called in the begining next frame.
- `requestAnimationFrame` is called before committing frame (layout calculation).

- `requestIdleCallback` is called at the end of frame (already commited), therefore, putting dom changes in this callback will make previous layout calculations invalidate and any style changes (normally, browser will batch style changes via queue) will be forced to flush if there is any layout reads via `getBoundingClientRect`. If you schedule `requestIdleCallback` callback inside another `requestIdleCallback` callback, it will be called in the next frame (It might change in the future).
