### Clean Code


#### Name

  + Name is not just for convention, it is a tool for communicate with others. Therefore choosing your names well and thoughtfully.

  + Name is using for communicate your intent.

  ```java
  int d; //elapsed time in days

  int elapsedTimeInDays;
  ```

  + Avoid disinformation, make sure a name says what it means.

  ```java
  Customer[] customerList; // it is not actually a list, it is just array
  Table theTable; // it is table type, the word "the" is just an unnecessary noise.

  Customer[] customers;
  Table customers;
  ```

  + Creat a name which people can pronounce because people are going to talk about your code.

  ```java
  Date genymdhms; // (generation date, year, month, day, hour, minute, second)

  Date generationTimestamp;
  ```

  + Avoid encodings because you don't need to keep track of all our types.

  ```java
  int iCount;

  int count;
  ```

  + The scope rules:

    + Variable names can be short, even one letter, if they are in a tiny little scope and long variable names for big scope.

    + Function names follow the opposite rule. Function names should be short if they have long scope, and long for short scope. Public methods normally have a short name, as opposite for private methods. Same rule for class

#### Function

  + Function should only do one thing.

  + Small function. Normally less than 10 lines, perfectly less than 5 lines. If you have many small functions, you will have many nice long descriptive name in your class. Especially, when you use those small functions in the other functions.

    > We human evolved to recognize the landscapes (long functions), navigate complex terrians by memorizing and recognizing the landmarks (part of codes in function), that is a very comfortable feeling to our reptilian hind-brain.

#### Architecture, Use Cases and High Level Design

  + Architecture is not based on tools and frameworks. It means that it does not depend on the delivery mechanism ( for example web).

  + It allows business to separate the costs of the use cases from the cost of UI or other components.

  + Use cases should be primary abstractions and central organizing of the system. It means when you look at a system you should see the intent of a system.

  + MVC/MVP might be good for web, therefore we use simple plain old objects to communicate between it and use cases.
