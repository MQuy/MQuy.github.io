## Common Table Expressions

A Common Table Expressions is the result set of a query which exists temporarily and for use only the context of a large query.

It is useful for those cases below:
  + Need to reference a derived table multiple times in a single query.
  + Perform the same calculation mutliple times over across multiple query components.

Example

```sql
-- define CTE:
WITH Cost_by_Month AS
(SELECT campaign_id AS campaign,
       TO_CHAR(created_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
       SUM(cost) AS monthly_cost
FROM marketing
WHERE created_date BETWEEN NOW() - INTERVAL '3 MONTH' AND NOW()
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2)

-- use CTE in subsequent query:
SELECT campaign, avg(monthly_cost) as "Avg Monthly Cost"
FROM Cost_by_Month
GROUP BY campaign
ORDER BY campaign
```

```sql

SELECT campaign, avg(monthly_cost) as "Avg Monthly Cost"
FROM
    -- this is where the derived query is used
    (SELECT campaign_id AS campaign,
       TO_CHAR(created_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
       SUM(cost) AS monthly_cost
    FROM marketing
    WHERE created_date BETWEEN NOW() - INTERVAL '3 MONTH' AND NOW()
    GROUP BY 1, 2
    ORDER BY 1, 2) as Cost_By_Month
GROUP BY campaign
ORDER BY campaign
```

### The different between CTE and Tmp Table

The example above can be rewritten using Tmp Table

```sql
SELECT campaign_id AS campaign,
       TO_CHAR(created_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
       SUM(cost) AS monthly_cost
INTO #tmpTable
FROM marketing
WHERE created_date BETWEEN NOW() - INTERVAL '3 MONTH' AND NOW()
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2

-- use CTE in subsequent query:
SELECT campaign, avg(monthly_cost) as "Avg Monthly Cost"
FROM #tmpTable
GROUP BY campaign
ORDER BY campaign
```

| CTE                            | Temp Table |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| are unindexable                | can be indexed                                    |
| can be recursive               | can not be recursive                              |
| temporary in memory            | are real materialized tables that exist in tempdb |
| only avaialbe in sql statement | from time it is created until the session is closed |

> for temp table, if you want to keep those temp tables between sessions, you can use global temp tables. It will be availabe until it is dropped or the server is restarted
